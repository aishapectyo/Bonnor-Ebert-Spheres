# Bonnor-Ebert-Spheres
Solve Bonnor-Ebert Spheres

This code solves the Lane-Emden equation, specifically the Bonnor-Ebert case.
The code uses several functions needed to find the mass, dimensionless radius, etc.
Once the code solves the general Lane-Emden the equation,  we provide guess values for the initial density which are then 
used to determine the matching parameters, e.g., dimensionless radius.  With a given dimenionsless radius and initial density, the code will determine if you have reached the desired Bonnor-Ebert sphere mass successfully.
